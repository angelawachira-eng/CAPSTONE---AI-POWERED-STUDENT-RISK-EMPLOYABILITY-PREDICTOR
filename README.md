## 1. Project Overview

Higher education institutions face two compounding crises: persistently high student dropout rates and a widening gap between academic graduation and job-market readiness. This project addresses both by building an end-to-end AI-powered prediction platform that:

- **Predicts student dropout risk** before it's too late to intervene.
- **Assesses employability readiness** so career services can be proactive.
- **Classifies academic performance** into actionable risk tiers.
- **Recommends job categories** from raw resume text using NLP.

The system spans four datasets, four classification tasks, and delivers interpretable predictions via SHAP explainability — designed for use by academic advisors, career services, and university administrators.

## 2. Business Understanding

### Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest |
|---|---|
| University Administration | Institutional retention rates and reputation |
| Academic Advisors | Early-warning signals for at-risk students |
| Students | Self-assessment and career planning |
| Career Services | Aligning student skills with industry demand |
| Employers | Identifying job-ready candidates |

### Business Problem

Institutions lack systematic, data-driven tools to flag struggling students early and connect graduates with career pathways that match their actual skill profiles. Manual processes are reactive — by the time a student is identified as at-risk, intervention opportunities are already limited.

### Key Questions Answered

1. What are the strongest predictors of student dropout?
2. How strongly do first-semester grades correlate with final graduation outcomes?
3. What impact do financial factors — scholarships and debt — have on student success?
4. Can we accurately predict a student's employability level from their academic and technical skill profile?

## 5. Datasets

Four datasets were used across the four prediction tasks:

| Dataset | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| UCI Dropout | `data.csv` | Predict Graduate / Enrolled / Dropout (semicolon-delimited) |
| Academic Risk DW | `Academic Risk Prediction DW.csv` | Predict High Performance / Average / At Risk |
| UECD Employability | `UECD_1200_dataset.csv` | Predict High / Medium / Low Readiness |
| Resume NLP | `Resume text.csv.gz` | Classify resume text into job categories |

> **Note on loading:** `data.csv` uses semicolons as delimiters (`sep=';'`). The resume file uses gzip compression with BOM encoding and requires a custom parser — see Notebook 1 for the `load_resume_csv()` helper function.

---

## 6. Methodology

The project follows the CRISP-DM framework across three sequential notebooks.

### 6.1 Data Cleaning (Notebook 1)

- Column names standardised to lowercase with underscores across all four datasets
- Corrected a misspelled column (`nacionality` → `nationality`) in the dropout dataset
- Dropped 36 fully-null rows and rows with missing target scores from the employability dataset
- Mode-imputed 18 missing values in `research_participation`
- Dropped 20 rows with missing `resume_text` from the resume dataset
- Created a binary `has_experience` flag from malformed `experience_years` values (values > 100 or ≤ 0 treated as no experience)
- All four cleaned datasets exported to `../data/` as CSV files

### 6.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (Notebook 2)

EDA was conducted separately for each dataset with targeted visualisations:

**Dropout dataset:** outcome distribution, age-at-enrolment histogram, first-semester grades by outcome, financial factor comparisons (scholarship & tuition status), outcome by debt status, combined financial pressure heatmap, gender split, curricular units approved per semester, and a full correlation matrix.

**Academic dataset:** grade distribution (A–D), grade split by gender, mean exam score by topic and school stage, study behaviour scatter plots (hours studied vs score, sleep vs score, absences vs score).

**Employability dataset:** employment competitiveness score distribution, GPA vs score scatter with trend line, top 8 features correlated with employability, and individual skill-score scatter plots.

**Resume dataset:** top 12 job category bar chart, most frequent keyword frequency bar chart.

### 6.3 Feature Engineering & Preprocessing (Notebook 2)

**Dropout dataset:**
- Engineered `total_units_approved` (Sem 1 + Sem 2 approved), `grade_improvement` (Sem 2 − Sem 1 grade), and `financial_pressure` flag (debtor = 1 AND tuition not up to date)
- Label-encoded the target column; StandardScaler applied to continuous features
- SMOTE applied to balance the three outcome classes

**Academic dataset:**
- Created `academic_status` target variable from grade letters (A/B → High Performance, C → Average, D → At Risk)
- Engineered `engagement_score` (mean of `raisedhands`, `visited_resources`, `announcements_view`, `discussion`) and `study_efficiency` (avg score / hours studied + 1)
- StandardScaler applied; SMOTE used to balance the three academic status classes

**Employability dataset:**
- Grouped raw skill columns into three composite scores: `tech_score_avg` (programming, tooling, domain knowledge, core subject), `soft_score_avg` (communication, teamwork, leadership, adaptability), and `career_score_avg` (career clarity, market awareness, learning motivation)
- Readiness level target created using 33rd/66th percentile thresholds on `employment_competitiveness_score`
- Classes were naturally balanced — no SMOTE required

**Resume dataset:**
- TF-IDF vectorisation (1,000 features, English stop-words removed)
- TruncatedSVD (LSA) compressed 1,000 word-features down to 10 latent topic components
- Final features: 10 topic components + `has_experience` binary flag
- Category label-encoded for model training

### 6.4 Modelling (Notebook 3)

For each of the four prediction tasks, models were trained, evaluated on a held-out 20% test set, and compared using weighted F1 score. The best model per domain was then hyperparameter-tuned.

**Models trained per task:**
- Dropout, Academic Risk, Employability: **Random Forest** vs **XGBoost**
- Resume NLP: **Logistic Regression** vs **Random Forest**

**Validation:**
- Stratified 80/20 train-test split (random seed 42 throughout)
- 5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation on the best model per domain to confirm stability
- RandomizedSearchCV (20 iterations, 5-fold CV) for hyperparameter tuning

**Explainability:**
- SHAP TreeExplainer applied to all three tree-based best models (Dropout, Academic, Employability)
- SHAP summary plots and global mean |SHAP value| bar charts generated for each domain

**Persistence:**
- Best and tuned models saved to `../models/` via `joblib` for deployment

## 7. Key Findings

### Dropout Prediction

- **First-semester grades are the single most powerful early signal.** Dropouts average 3.4 grade points lower than graduates in Semester 1 — flagging is possible as early as Week 14 of Year 1.
- **Units approved per semester matter more than raw grades.** Graduates approve ~5.9 units per semester; dropouts approve fewer than 2. A student approving zero or one unit in Semester 1 is a near-certain dropout signal.
- **Financial pressure compounds risk sharply.** Students who are both in debt and have overdue tuition face the highest dropout rates — the Debtor × Tuition heatmap is the most actionable single chart for institutional intervention.
- **Scholarship holders graduate at nearly double the rate of non-holders.** Students with tuition up-to-date graduate at ~82% vs ~35% for those who are behind.
- **Male students are disproportionately overrepresented among dropouts** (~58%) relative to their total enrolment share, despite female students showing stronger graduation rates overall.

### Academic Risk

- GPA and engagement score (a composite of class participation, resource visits, and discussions) are the dominant predictors of academic risk tier.
- Low-engagement students can be flagged before exam season, enabling early tutoring referrals.
- Study efficiency (score per hour studied) matters more than raw hours studied alone.

### Employability

- **GPA alone does not determine job readiness.** A student with a 3.8 GPA can score anywhere from 50 to 95 on the employment competitiveness scale — technical skills, career clarity, and soft skills add substantial independent predictive power.
- Tech skill composite score is the top SHAP driver of High Readiness predictions.
- Career clarity and market awareness add value beyond both GPA and raw skill scores.

### Resume NLP

- TF-IDF + LSA (10 topics) successfully captures latent semantic structure from raw resume text.
- The `has_experience` flag contributes meaningfully alongside topic features.
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression on the multi-class NLP task.
